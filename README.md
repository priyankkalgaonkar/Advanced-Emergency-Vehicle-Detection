# Advanced-Emergency-Vehicle-Detection
Also known as: Emergency Vehicle Detection Using Sound Localization and Digital Processing Techniques

Our prototype utilizes an array of microphones pointing in different directions and LED bulbs to display the direction of travel of emergency vehicles. The assumption is that the array of microphones should be receiving the same auditory signals but at different intervals of time. The sound captured by an array of microphones will be sampled. It will then be filtered and angle of the receiving sound-wave that corresponds to the frequency of the emergency vehiclesâ€™ sirens will be used to determine the direction of the corresponding sound-wave and light up the LEDs accordingly.
